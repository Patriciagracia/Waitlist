# Waitlist

This project is built with Vite and incorporates EmailJS, a backend-as-a-service tool for sending emails directly from client or server-side code. The app has a simple and user-friendly interface, with cool CSS animations. Bootstrap is used to make sure it is responsive.

## Tech Stack

- **Vite** - Fast build tool for modern web projects
- **React** - JavaScript library for building UI
- **EmailJS** - Send emails without a backend
- **Bootstrap** - Ensures responsiveness and styling
- **Sass** - CSS preprocessor for advanced styling
